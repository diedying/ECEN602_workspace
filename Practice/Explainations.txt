1. Run 'gcc' to compile sources
gcc Server.c -o server
gcc Client.c -o client
[chmod +x client] [chmod +x server]

2. Two terminals A & B
A: {
	./server	
}
(After server is open, this sample has no prompts, so just wait for little time will do)

B. {
	./client "hera.ece.tamu.edu"
}
(Same as above, wait for a second)

Type in Terminal B like Message from client will show on Terminal A, that's it.
